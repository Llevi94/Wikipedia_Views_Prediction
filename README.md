# Wikipedia_ML_Data_science_Project
------------------

Machine Learning, Data science, Wikipedia project – Python, Jupyter Notebook:
The purpose of the project is to build a predictive model for the research question – "predicting the number of views of a Wikipedia page based on its characteristics". A group of suitable data is identified and acquired by crawling and API library, analysis and handling of data, use of EDA visualization, advanced analysis and selection of machine learning methods - their application linear regression, logistic regression and KNN.

Libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- math
- sklearn

Note: Attached is a Python notebook (wiki_crawling) that contains the crawling code, there is an explanation of how to activate it and this data can be added to the attached CSV file.
